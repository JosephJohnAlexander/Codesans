When I was creating Nailbody, I want to have a monospaced/duospaced sans serif typeface, because I always think that serifs and sanses are basic fonts. There are several fonts I have wanted, but none of them satisfy me.

[Inconsolata](https://github.com/googlefonts/Inconsolata) is relased under SIL OpenFont License. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives. And there are no vertical lines but slashes in the glyph of the number sign.

Selectric Advocate is not free for commercial usages.

[DEC Terminal Modern](https://www.dafont.com/dec-terminal-modern.font) is free for personal usages, I don't know whether it is free in usages of other hands (for example, commercial usages).

[Glass TTY VT220](https://github.com/svofski/glasstty)'s glyphs seem not clear.

[IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex/tree/master/packages/plex-mono) is released under SIL OpenFont License, and I don't accept glyphs of numbers 6 and 9.

Characters from E000 to E005 are numbers I designed for hexadecimal, because I think the style of glyphs of latin alphabets from A to F, are different from the style of glyphs from characters 0 to 9. I designed a character as the symbol of the hexadecimal number system and stored it at codepoint E006.

I created some handscript-style glyphs, and made them oblique, that is just the Italic. I stored the original version (did not oblique) of these handscript-style glyphs in Codesans Upright Script. The name 'Upright' is derived from 'upright italics' of the third sentence of the first paragraph of the context of 'How much slant?' of http://designwithfontforge.com/en-US/Italic.html.
