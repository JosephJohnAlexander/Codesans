When I was creating Nailbody, I want a monospaced/duospaced sans serif, because I always think that serifs and sanses are basic fonts. There are several fonts I have wanted, but none of them satisfy me.
	
Inconsolata is relased under SIL OpenFont License. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives. And there are no vertical lines but slashes in the glyph of the number sign (ASCII hexadecimal: 23).

Selectric Advocate is not free for commercial usages.

DEC Terminal Modern is not free for commerical usages.

Glass TTY VT220's glyphs are not clear.
 
IBM Plex Mono is released under SIL OpenFont License, and I don't accept glyphs of numbers 6 and 9.

<BACKUPED>This font is released without licences, just like the copyright of the Pythagorean theorem, or sheet musics of symphonies written by Ludwig Van Beethoven.

This font is free. It can be used for commerical and noncommercial partly or entirely. You don't need to ask me for allow use this font for anywhere, anything - this font is entirely free in anywhere and for any things. Once you obtained copies of this font, you are the master of copies of this font you got. You may do anything to this font.

You may do things to this font, including, but not limited to edit, display and print, and respread (free or sell; for copies or modifications)

You may do one or multiple kinds of things listed above. You may do each kind of things in one or multiple times. If you want to do a kind of things in mulitple times, you may do times of the kind continuously or discontinuously.

If you are going to release the copy of this font, or going to release modifications of this font, you may release under any of licences.</BACKUPED>

Originally I decided to release this font under a permissive licence, but later I gave up. The reason I don't release this font under licences, is I think licences contains rules, when users are seeing licences, they will be afraid of licences, or they will think there are restrictions or requirements for them when they are using this font.

Characters from E000 to E005 are numbers I designed for hexadecimal, because I think the glyph of numbers from 0 to 9, and glyphs of latin alphabets from A to F, are different. Character E006 is designed for indicating hexadecimal number system, I defined it as the single character symbol that indicates the hexadecimal number system.
