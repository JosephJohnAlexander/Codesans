REASONS OF CREATING THIS FONT

	When I was creating Nailbody, I want a monospaced/duospaced sans serif,
 	because I always think that serifs and sanses are basic fonts. There are
   	several fonts I have wanted, but none of them satisfy me.

	Inconsolata is relased under SIL OpenFont License, this licence forces
	font modifications, of a font under this licence. And there are no
	vertical lines but slashes in the glyph of the number sign (ASCII
 	hexadecimal: 23).

	Selectric Advocate is not free for commercial usages.

	DEC Terminal Modern is not free for commerical usages.

	Glass TTY VT220's glyphs are not clear.
 
	IBM Plex Mono is released under SIL OpenFont License, and I don't accept
	glyphs of numbers 6 and 9.

THE PROCESS OF CREATIONS OF THIS FONT

	I used pencil to draw glyphs of characters on papers, and use an eraser
	to correct glyphs. Then, I used a Kodak Pixpro AZ901 to take photos of
	glyphs (mostly DNGs, some are JPGs), and import photos to a PC that runs
	Microsoft Windows, used the ArcSoft PhotoStudio Darkroom to cut photos,
	then generated 16-bit TIFF photos. I used FontCreator Professional to
	create a font project, import photos cutted to characters of the font
	project to generate glyphs of characters, and exported as a font file.
	The reason I did not use FontForge to create the font is, I don't know
	whether FontForge supports importing photo files to a font.

	I did not upload DNG/JPG files, because I deleted a part ZIP file
	wrongly - the GitHub website does not allow uploading any file that its
	size exceeds 25 MB, so I created ZIP files, move DNG/JPG files into ZIP
	files, according Unicode blocks and Unicode codepoints of characters
	associated to DNG/JPG files, one Unicode block per ZIP file, then I used
	7-Zip to split ZIP files, but I deleted a part ZIP file its name seems
	ended with zip, and clear the Recycle Bin, then I found there is not a
	file its name with the same prefix to other part ZIP files and ended
	with .zip.01, so I know I deleted a part of a splitted ZIP file. I did
	not backup ZIP or DNG/JPG files before I delete the part 01, so I think
	leave rest parts of ZIP files are meaningless, because I have lost a
	part of a ZIP file, this means I have lost a ZIP file, and I have lost a
	block of characters of DNG files, so I deleted all ZIP files.

PERMISSIONS OF USAGES OF THIS FONT

	This font is released without licences, just like the copyright of
	Pythagorean theorem, or the copyright of sheet musics of symphonies
	written by Ludwig Van Beethoven.

	This font is free. It can be used for commerical and noncommercial
	partly or entirely. You don't need to ask me for allow use this font for
	anywhere, anything - this font is entirely free in anywhere and for any
	things. Once you obtained copies of this font, you are the master of
	copies of this font you got. You may do anything to this font.

	You may do things to this font, including, but not limited to:

		Edit
		Display and print
		Respread (free or sell; for copies or modifications)

	You may do one or multiple kinds of things listed above. You may do each
	kind of things in one or multiple times. If you want to do a kind of
	things in mulitple times, you may do times of the kind continuously or
	discontinuously.

	If you are going to release the copy of this font, or going to release
	modifications of this font, you may release under any of licences.

	Originally I decided to release this font under a permissive licence,
	but later I gave up. The reason I don't release this font under
	licences, is I think licences contains rules, when users are seeing
	licences, they will be afraid of licences, or they will think there are
	restrictions or requirements for them when they are using this font.

	Characters from E000 to E005 are numbers I designed for hexadecimal,
	because I think the glyph of numbers from 0 to 9, and glyphs of latin
	alphabets from A to F, are different. Character E006 is designed for
	indicating hexadecimal number system, if you want to use a single symbol
	to indicate hexadecimal number system.
