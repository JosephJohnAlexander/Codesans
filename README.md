When I was creating Nailbody, I want to have a monospaced/duospaced sans serif typeface, because I always think that serifs and sanses are basic fonts. There are several fonts I have wanted, but none of them satisfy me.
	
Inconsolata is relased under SIL OpenFont License. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives. And there are no vertical lines but slashes in the glyph of the number sign (ASCII hexadecimal: 23).

Selectric Advocate is not free for commercial usages.

DEC Terminal Modern is free for personal usages, I don't know whether it is free in usages of other hands (for example, commercial usages).

Glass TTY VT220's glyphs seem not clear.
 
IBM Plex Mono is released under SIL OpenFont License, and I don't accept glyphs of numbers 6 and 9.

Characters from E012 to E017 are numbers I designed for hexadecimal, because I think the style of glyphs of latin alphabets from A to F, are different from the style of glyphs from characters 0 to 9. I designed a character as the symbol of the hexadecimal number system and stored it at codepoint E018.
